# Italian Elections Turnout
---
**AUTHOR**: Alberto Martino

The notebook analyses the current trend of turnout in the Italian General Elections, with some possible predictions.

In this research I analysed the Italian General Elections and their respective turnout. My aim is to understand and verify if the current trend of low electoral participation can be appreciated on a larger scale in the past and in the future, researching the causes of this issue and the possible solutions.

## Context and Topic

### Italian General Elections 
The general elections determine the composition of the Italian Parliament. They are held every five year at maximum or before in case of early dissolution. Similar to the English bicameralism, the Italian Parliament is made up of two Chambers, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies whose members are elected through these general elections.

### Voter Eligibility 

The minimum requirement to vote is to be 18 years or over on the day of the Elections. Voting privileges can be revoked in peculiar cases. Hence, the turnout percentages shown later in this analysis are calculated on the basis of the eligible population. 

### Note

To have a clearer and more transparent view of the analysis, I will remove the turnout levels in General Elections held during the monarchical period, considering only elections held on and after the day of the Republic-Monarchy Referendum and the elections of the Constituent Assembly (i.e., the authors of the Italian Constitution), the 2nd of June 1946.
